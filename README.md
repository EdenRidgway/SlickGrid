[SlickGrid](https://github.com/jlynch7/SlickGrid/wiki) - A lightning fast JavaScript grid/spreadsheet
==================================================

This Fork's Features
--------------------------------------

Frozen Rows (top & bottom)<br>
Frozen Columns (left only, right coming soon)<br>
Horizontal scrolling of frozen viewport with mousewheel<br>
Scroll viewport during row drag<br>
Scroll viewport during column drag<br>

I've merged in the grouped headers functionality from: https://github.com/hariharanpalani/SlickGrid

So now you can have both frozen columns and colspan headers. See the example: example-header-grouping-frozen-columns.html to see this in action.
